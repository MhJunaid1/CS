Yes, the concepts of stack and heap are used in both data structures and operating systems.

In data structures, a stack is an abstract data type that stores and retrieves data items in a Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) manner.
It is often used for tasks such as parsing expressions and handling function calls in programming languages.
A heap, on the other hand, is a data structure that is used to represent a binary tree with a particular property called the heap property.
The heap property ensures that the root node of the binary tree contains either the minimum or maximum value of all the nodes in the tree.

In operating systems, the stack and heap are used to manage the memory used by programs. 
The stack is used to store temporary data such as function parameters, local variables, and return addresses. 
The heap is used to store dynamically allocated memory that is requested at runtime using functions such as malloc() and new(). 
Operating systems use these concepts to allocate and manage memory efficiently, preventing programs from running out of memory or 
causing other programs to crash due to memory conflicts.
