Message Storage settings in Mirth Connect. These settings determine how much of the message data is stored in the Mirth database for later retrieval and analysis. Here's a breakdown of the options:

### 1. **Development**
   - **Purpose:** This setting is ideal for debugging and development purposes.
   - **Behavior:** It stores the entire message (both raw and transformed data) along with metadata, making it easy to troubleshoot and test channels. This can consume a lot of storage space, so it's typically used only during development.

### 2. **Production**
   - **Purpose:** This setting is used in live environments where you want to store essential information but avoid excessive storage usage.
   - **Behavior:** It stores only the metadata and possibly the transformed message, depending on the configuration. The raw message might not be stored, reducing the storage footprint while still retaining enough data for most troubleshooting needs.

### 3. **Raw**
   - **Purpose:** This is useful when you need to store the unaltered original message for compliance or auditing purposes.
   - **Behavior:** It stores only the raw message (the original data received by the channel) along with some metadata. The transformed message is not stored.

### 4. **Metadata**
   - **Purpose:** This option is used when you want to store minimal information, mainly for tracking and auditing.
   - **Behavior:** It stores only the metadata (e.g., message ID, timestamps, etc.) without any message content (raw or transformed). This is very light on storage and is often used when message content storage isn't necessary.

### 5. **Disabled**
   - **Purpose:** This is used when you want to completely disable message storage for a channel.
   - **Behavior:** No message data or metadata is stored. This is useful when storage is not needed, but it also means no data will be available for review or troubleshooting after processing.

### **When to Use Each Setting**
- **Development:** Use when actively building or debugging a channel.
- **Production:** Use in live environments where you need to balance storage use with the need for troubleshooting data.
- **Raw:** Use when you must store original messages, perhaps for compliance reasons.
- **Metadata:** Use when you need minimal storage for tracking purposes.
- **Disabled:** Use when you don't need to store any data and want to conserve resources.

These settings help you manage the trade-off between the amount of data stored and the ability to troubleshoot issues later.
