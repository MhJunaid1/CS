Computers understand text by converting it into a form they can process, which is ultimately binary data (a series of 0s and 1s). Here's a breakdown of how this works:

### 1. **Character Encoding**
At the most basic level, a computer stores and manipulates data as binary numbers (0s and 1s). To represent text in binary, computers use **character encoding schemes** like ASCII or Unicode, which map each character (letters, numbers, symbols) to a specific binary value.

#### **ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange)**
- One of the earliest character encoding standards.
- Maps 128 characters (including English letters, digits, and some control characters like new lines) to binary values using 7 bits per character.
  - Example: The character 'A' is represented by the binary value `01000001`, which is equivalent to 65 in decimal.

#### **Unicode**
- A more comprehensive standard to represent characters from multiple languages, symbols, and emojis.
- Uses different encoding formats like **UTF-8**, **UTF-16**, and **UTF-32** to represent over a million characters.
  - UTF-8 is the most widely used encoding, where a character can take between 1 and 4 bytes depending on its value.
  - Example: The letter 'A' in UTF-8 is still `01000001`, but characters from non-Latin alphabets, like 'अ' (Hindi letter 'A'), have longer binary representations.

### 2. **Binary Representation of Text**
Once a text is encoded into its corresponding binary form using character encoding (like ASCII or Unicode), the computer can store and manipulate it. Here's an example of how a string might be processed:

Let’s take the string "Hello" as an example:
- The character 'H' in ASCII is represented by the binary value `01001000`.
- The character 'e' is `01100101`.
- The character 'l' is `01101100`.
- The second 'l' is `01101100`.
- The character 'o' is `01101111`.

So, the string "Hello" would be stored in binary as:
```
01001000 01100101 01101100 01101100 01101111
```

### 3. **Processing Text**
Once text is represented in binary, the computer can perform various operations:
- **Storage**: The binary representation of text can be written to a storage device (like a hard drive or memory).
- **Manipulation**: Software can manipulate text by changing the binary values. For example, adding, deleting, or transforming characters.
- **Display**: To display text, the binary values are interpreted by software (like an operating system or a web browser) and rendered on the screen as human-readable characters.

### 4. **Input and Output of Text**
When you type something on a keyboard:
- Each key press is translated into a binary code using the character encoding scheme (usually Unicode or ASCII).
- This binary code is then sent to the computer's processor for interpretation and further action.

When the computer displays text:
- The binary values stored for each character are translated back into symbols or letters, which are then rendered on the display.

### 5. **Text in Different Languages**
For non-English text (like Chinese, Arabic, or Hindi), Unicode is essential because ASCII can only represent a limited set of characters. Unicode assigns a unique number to every character in every language, which is then encoded into binary and processed in the same way.

For instance, the Chinese character '你' (which means "you") has a Unicode code point of U+4F60, and its UTF-8 representation is `11100100 10111110 10100000`.

### 6. **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**
When computers need to **understand** text in a more sophisticated manner (for example, recognizing meaning, context, or sentiment), they rely on **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques. NLP involves algorithms and models trained on large datasets of human language to process and derive meaning from text, such as:
- **Tokenization**: Breaking text into words or smaller parts.
- **Parsing**: Analyzing the grammatical structure of a sentence.
- **Semantics**: Understanding the meaning of words and sentences.
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Determining the emotion or attitude behind the text.

### Summary
To summarize:
- **Text** is converted into binary using **character encoding schemes** like ASCII or Unicode.
- **Binary data** is processed, stored, and displayed by the computer.
- Complex tasks, like understanding meaning, involve **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**.
