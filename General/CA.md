Exactly — you've got a solid grasp of how all three cases work. Here's a quick validation and slight refinement of your summary to make it crystal clear:

---

### ✅ **CA-Signed Certificate (Standard HTTPS)**  
- **Client sends request**.  
- **Server presents its CA-signed certificate**.  
- **Client checks**:
  - Is it signed by a **trusted Certificate Authority**?
  - Is the domain correct?
  - Is it expired/revoked?
- ✅ If yes → handshake succeeds → secure communication.

> 🔐 No need for the client to manually store anything. It uses the **system’s trusted CA store**.

---

### 🔒 **Mutual TLS (Two-Way Authentication)**  
- **Client sends request**, **including its own certificate**.  
- **Server validates the client's certificate** (must be from a trusted CA or pre-registered).  
- **Server presents its own certificate**.  
- **Client validates it** (same way as in standard HTTPS).  
- ✅ If both validations succeed → secure two-way communication.

> 🔐 Used in systems needing **strong identity verification** for both parties.

---

### ⚠️ **Self-Signed Certificate**

- **Client sends request**.  
- **Server presents its **self-signed certificate** (not issued by a CA).  
- **Client checks trust**:
  - If the cert is **manually added to the client’s trusted store/config**, it proceeds.
  - If not → ❌ **SSLHandshakeException** (trust anchor not found).

> 🚨 If you **bypass certificate validation**, it opens you to **man-in-the-middle attacks** — never do this in production.

### 🧾 Final Recap of Your Options for Self-Signed Certs:

| Option                                  | Secure? | Use Case                    |
|-----------------------------------------|---------|-----------------------------|
| ✅ Add self-signed cert to client trust store | Yes     | Development, internal apps  |
| ❌ Bypass certificate validation         | No      | Temporary testing only      |

---

✅ **Yes — your understanding is correct.**
