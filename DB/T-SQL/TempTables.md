### Understanding the Difference Between Declaring and Using `TABLE` Keyword vs Temporary Tables in SQL Server

In SQL Server, both **declaring a table** and using **temporary tables** can be used to store intermediate results or perform operations on data without affecting the actual database. However, there are important differences between the two methods in terms of scope, storage, and performance. This article explains these differences and when to use each approach.

### 1. Declaring a Table with the `TABLE` Keyword

The `TABLE` keyword is used in SQL Server to declare a **table variable**. This creates a table in memory that can store a small set of rows. A table variable is defined using the `DECLARE` statement and exists only within the scope of the batch or stored procedure where it is declared.

#### Syntax:
```sql
DECLARE @MyTable TABLE (
    Column1 INT,
    Column2 NVARCHAR(50)
);
```

#### Example:
```sql
DECLARE @Products TABLE (
    ProductID INT,
    ProductName NVARCHAR(50)
);

INSERT INTO @Products (ProductID, ProductName)
VALUES (1, 'Laptop'), (2, 'Mobile Phone');

SELECT * FROM @Products;
```

#### Characteristics of Table Variables:
- **Scope:** A table variable only exists within the current batch, function, or stored procedure. Once the batch is complete, the table variable is automatically destroyed.
- **Memory Usage:** Table variables are primarily stored in memory, making them ideal for small datasets.
- **Transaction Handling:** Table variables are not affected by transactions, meaning if a transaction is rolled back, the changes made to the table variable remain.
- **Indexing:** While you can declare a primary key or unique constraint, table variables generally support limited indexing options.

#### When to Use:
- When you are working with **small datasets** that fit into memory.
- When you need a **local, short-lived table** to store intermediate results.
- When **transaction management** is not critical for the data.

### 2. Temporary Tables in SQL Server

Temporary tables are more versatile and powerful than table variables. These tables are created using the `CREATE TABLE` statement or the shorthand `SELECT INTO` and are stored in the **tempdb** database. Temporary tables can handle larger datasets and support more indexing options.

#### Types of Temporary Tables:
- **Local Temporary Tables:** These are prefixed with a single `#` and are visible only to the session that created them.
- **Global Temporary Tables:** These are prefixed with `##` and can be accessed by all sessions.

#### Syntax:
```sql
CREATE TABLE #MyTempTable (
    Column1 INT,
    Column2 NVARCHAR(50)
);
```

#### Example:
```sql
CREATE TABLE #Orders (
    OrderID INT,
    CustomerName NVARCHAR(50)
);

INSERT INTO #Orders (OrderID, CustomerName)
VALUES (1, 'John Doe'), (2, 'Jane Smith');

SELECT * FROM #Orders;

DROP TABLE #Orders; -- To clean up the temporary table
```

#### Characteristics of Temporary Tables:
- **Scope:** A local temporary table (`#TableName`) is visible only to the current session, while a global temporary table (`##TableName`) is visible across all sessions. Once the session is closed or the table is dropped, the temporary table is destroyed.
- **Disk-Based Storage:** Temporary tables are stored in the `tempdb` system database, allowing them to hold larger datasets than table variables.
- **Transactions:** Temporary tables are fully affected by transactions. If a transaction is rolled back, the changes to the temporary table are rolled back as well.
- **Indexing:** Temporary tables can have indexes and constraints, making them suitable for complex queries and large datasets.

#### When to Use:
- When you need to **store a larger amount of data** or perform complex operations like sorting or aggregating.
- When you need **transactional control** over the temporary data.
- When you want to use **indexes or constraints** for faster query execution on the temporary table.

### Key Differences

| Aspect                   | Table Variables (`DECLARE @MyTable`)        | Temporary Tables (`#TempTable`)            |
|--------------------------|--------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| **Scope**                 | Exists within the batch or stored procedure | Exists in the session or globally         |
| **Storage**               | Primarily in memory                        | Stored in the `tempdb` database           |
| **Performance**           | Suitable for small datasets                | Better for larger datasets and complex queries |
| **Transaction Handling**  | Not affected by transactions               | Fully affected by transactions            |
| **Indexing**              | Limited indexing options                   | Can use indexes, constraints, and keys    |
| **Persistence**           | Automatically destroyed at the end of the batch | Destroyed when the session ends or explicitly dropped |

### Conclusion

In SQL Server, choosing between a table variable (using `DECLARE @MyTable`) and a temporary table (using `#TempTable`) depends on the nature of the task. Table variables are better suited for small datasets and in-memory operations, while temporary tables are ideal for larger datasets, complex queries, and scenarios requiring indexing and transactional control. By understanding their differences, you can choose the most efficient approach for your SQL queries and stored procedures.
