In SQL Server, the `STUFF` function is used to insert a string into another string by removing a specified length of characters from the original string and replacing them with the new string. It's particularly useful for string manipulation tasks.

Here's the syntax for the `STUFF` function:

```sql
STUFF (string_expression, start, length, replace_with)
```

- **`string_expression`**: The original string.
- **`start`**: The starting position in the original string where the replacement begins. (1-based index)
- **`length`**: The number of characters to delete from the original string.
- **`replace_with`**: The string to insert into the original string.

### Example

Suppose you have the following string: `'Hello World'` and you want to replace `'World'` with `'SQL Server'`.

```sql
SELECT STUFF('Hello World', 7, 5, 'SQL Server') AS Result;
```

In this example:
- `'Hello World'` is the original string.
- `7` is the starting position (the 'W' in 'World').
- `5` is the number of characters to remove ('World' has 5 characters).
- `'SQL Server'` is the string to insert.

The result would be `'Hello SQL Server'`.
