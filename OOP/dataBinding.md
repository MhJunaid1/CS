Data binding is a technique used in software development to establish a connection
between the user interface (UI) elements of an application and the underlying data or business logic.
It allows for automatic synchronization and propagation of data changes between the UI and the data source without the need for manual intervention.

In data binding, the UI elements, such as text fields, checkboxes, or lists, are bound to specific data variables or properties.
When the data changes, the UI is automatically updated to reflect the new values, and vice versa.
This enables a seamless interaction between the user and the application,
as any changes made by the user in the UI are immediately reflected in the underlying data, and any changes in the data are instantly displayed in the UI.

You are correct. In data binding, when the user interface (UI) changes,
the underlying data or database connected to it is updated, and vice versa.
However, there may be cases where you don't want the user to directly modify the data or where you want to control the data modifications.
