class BankAccount {
private:
    string accountNumber;
    double balance;
public:
    void deposit(double amount) {
        balance += amount;
    }
    void withdraw(double amount) {
        balance -= amount;
    }
    double getBalance() {
        return balance;
    }
};
In this example, the class has two private data members, accountNumber and balance, and three public methods, deposit, withdraw, and getBalance.
The deposit and withdraw methods modify the balance data member, while the getBalance method returns the value of balance.

By making the data members private and the methods public, we have encapsulated the data and provided a well-defined interface for interacting with the bank account.
Clients of the BankAccount class can only access the data and methods that are explicitly made public,
and cannot modify the accountNumber or balance data members directly.
