In C#, the `internal` access modifier is used to control the visibility of a class, method, or other members within the **current assembly**. To understand what **current assembly** means in this context, let's break it down:

### What is an Assembly in C#?
An **assembly** is a compiled code library used in .NET applications. It can be either an **executable file (.exe)** or a **dynamic link library (.dll)**. An assembly contains compiled code (in the form of **CIL**, Common Intermediate Language) and metadata, including information about the types and methods it contains.

In simple terms, an assembly is the output of your project when it is compiled. For example:
- If you compile a console application, the output is an **assembly** in the form of a `.exe` file.
- If you compile a class library, the output is an **assembly** in the form of a `.dll` file.

### What Does `internal` Mean?
The `internal` access modifier restricts access to the members of a class or a class itself to **only within the same assembly**. This means that any code inside the same assembly can access `internal` members, but code in **other assemblies** (like external projects or libraries) cannot access them.

### What is the "Current Assembly"?

The **current assembly** refers to the assembly that contains the code with the `internal` members. Any code that is part of this assembly can access `internal` members.

- If you're working within the same project, all files in that project are compiled into the same assembly, so they can access `internal` members.
- If you're working with multiple projects in a solution, each project usually compiles into a separate assembly. In this case, `internal` members in one project/assembly would not be accessible to code in another project/assembly unless special rules like `InternalsVisibleTo` are used.

### Example:

Consider this `internal` class in a C# project:

```csharp
internal class MyClass
{
    internal void MyMethod()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Internal method in current assembly.");
    }
}
```

1. **Inside the same assembly** (e.g., another class in the same project), you can access this class and its method:

   ```csharp
   public class AnotherClass
   {
       public void Test()
       {
           MyClass obj = new MyClass();
           obj.MyMethod();  // This works because it's in the same assembly
       }
   }
   ```

2. **In a different assembly** (e.g., another project or a separate library), you **cannot** access `MyClass` or `MyMethod`, because they are marked as `internal`:

   ```csharp
   // This code in a different assembly would not compile
   public class ExternalClass
   {
       public void Test()
       {
           MyClass obj = new MyClass();  // Error: MyClass is internal
           obj.MyMethod();               // Error: MyMethod is internal
       }
   }
   ```

### Summary of `internal` in C#:
- **`internal`** limits access to the **current assembly**.
- Members with `internal` access can only be used by code within the same assembly.
- Code in other assemblies cannot access `internal` members unless explicitly allowed through mechanisms like `InternalsVisibleTo`.
