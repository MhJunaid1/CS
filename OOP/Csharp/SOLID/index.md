The **SOLID principles** are a set of five design principles in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) that make software designs more understandable, flexible, and maintainable. These principles were introduced by Robert C. Martin (Uncle Bob) and are often used as a foundation for good software design practices.

Let's go through each SOLID principle in detail with examples in C#.

### **S** - **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**
**Definition**: A class should have one, and only one, reason to change, meaning that a class should have only one job or responsibility.

#### Why SRP?
- Makes the class simpler to understand and maintain.
- Reduces the risk of changes causing unintended side effects.
  
#### Example in C#:
```csharp
public class Invoice
{
    public void GenerateInvoice() 
    {
        // Logic for generating the invoice
    }

    public void SendEmailNotification() 
    {
        // Logic for sending email notification
    }
}
```
**What's wrong?**
- This `Invoice` class violates SRP because it has two responsibilities: generating the invoice and sending email notifications.

**Solution**: Split responsibilities into separate classes:
```csharp
public class Invoice
{
    public void GenerateInvoice()
    {
        // Logic for generating invoice
    }
}

public class EmailNotifier
{
    public void SendEmail(string email)
    {
        // Logic for sending email
    }
}
```

### **O** - **Open/Closed Principle (OCP)**
**Definition**: Software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extension but closed for modification.

#### Why OCP?
- Allows for new functionality without changing existing code, minimizing the risk of introducing bugs.
  
#### Example in C#:
```csharp
public class PaymentProcessor
{
    public void ProcessCreditCardPayment() 
    {
        // Logic for processing credit card payment
    }

    public void ProcessPaypalPayment() 
    {
        // Logic for processing PayPal payment
    }
}
```
**What's wrong?**
- If a new payment method is introduced (e.g., Bitcoin), we have to modify the `PaymentProcessor` class, violating the OCP principle.

**Solution**: Use abstraction (interfaces or abstract classes) to extend behavior without modifying existing code:
```csharp
public interface IPaymentMethod
{
    void ProcessPayment();
}

public class CreditCardPayment : IPaymentMethod
{
    public void ProcessPayment() 
    {
        // Logic for credit card payment
    }
}

public class PaypalPayment : IPaymentMethod
{
    public void ProcessPayment()
    {
        // Logic for PayPal payment
    }
}

public class PaymentProcessor
{
    private IPaymentMethod paymentMethod;

    public PaymentProcessor(IPaymentMethod paymentMethod)
    {
        this.paymentMethod = paymentMethod;
    }

    public void Process()
    {
        paymentMethod.ProcessPayment();
    }
}
```
Now, you can add new payment methods (like Bitcoin) by creating a new class without changing `PaymentProcessor`.

### **L** - **Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)**
**Definition**: Objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of a subclass without affecting the correctness of the program.

#### Why LSP?
- Ensures that derived classes extend the base class without altering its behavior in unexpected ways.
  
#### Example in C#:
```csharp
public class Rectangle
{
    public virtual int Width { get; set; }
    public virtual int Height { get; set; }

    public int Area()
    {
        return Width * Height;
    }
}

public class Square : Rectangle
{
    public override int Width
    {
        set { base.Width = base.Height = value; }
    }

    public override int Height
    {
        set { base.Width = base.Height = value; }
    }
}
```
**What's wrong?**
- `Square` violates LSP because it changes the behavior of `Rectangle`. If you pass a `Square` object where a `Rectangle` is expected, it will not behave as expected.

**Solution**: Avoid this inheritance hierarchy. Use composition instead.
```csharp
public class Square
{
    public int SideLength { get; set; }

    public int Area()
    {
        return SideLength * SideLength;
    }
}
```

### **I** - **Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)**
**Definition**: Clients should not be forced to depend on methods they do not use. Instead of having large interfaces, create smaller, more specific ones.

#### Why ISP?
- Prevents "fat interfaces" that force classes to implement methods that they don’t need.

#### Example in C#:
```csharp
public interface IWorker
{
    void Work();
    void Eat();
}
```
**What's wrong?**
- Not all workers may need the `Eat` method. For instance, robots might not.

**Solution**: Split into more focused interfaces:
```csharp
public interface IWorkable
{
    void Work();
}

public interface IFeedable
{
    void Eat();
}

public class HumanWorker : IWorkable, IFeedable
{
    public void Work() { /* Working logic */ }
    public void Eat() { /* Eating logic */ }
}

public class RobotWorker : IWorkable
{
    public void Work() { /* Working logic */ }
}
```
Now, only `HumanWorker` implements `IEatable`, and `RobotWorker` doesn't need to.

### **D** - **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)**
**Definition**: High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions. Abstractions should not depend on details; details should depend on abstractions.

#### Why DIP?
- Promotes loose coupling and flexibility by relying on abstractions rather than concrete implementations.

#### Example in C#:
```csharp
public class EmailService
{
    public void SendEmail() 
    {
        // Logic to send an email
    }
}

public class Notification
{
    private EmailService emailService;

    public Notification()
    {
        emailService = new EmailService();
    }

    public void Send()
    {
        emailService.SendEmail();
    }
}
```
**What's wrong?**
- The `Notification` class depends on a concrete implementation of `EmailService`, making it hard to extend (e.g., sending SMS notifications).

**Solution**: Depend on abstractions (interfaces) instead:
```csharp
public interface IMessageService
{
    void SendMessage();
}

public class EmailService : IMessageService
{
    public void SendMessage() 
    {
        // Logic to send an email
    }
}

public class SMSService : IMessageService
{
    public void SendMessage()
    {
        // Logic to send an SMS
    }
}

public class Notification
{
    private IMessageService messageService;

    public Notification(IMessageService messageService)
    {
        this.messageService = messageService;
    }

    public void Send()
    {
        messageService.SendMessage();
    }
}
```
Now, `Notification` depends on the `IMessageService` abstraction, and it’s easy to add new message types (SMS, Push Notifications, etc.).

2. **Open/Closed Principle (OCP)**: Classes should be open for extension, but closed for modification.
3. **Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)**: Subclasses should be replaceable by their base classes without affecting the program.
4. **Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)**: Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they don’t use.
5. **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)**: High-level modules should depend on abstractions, not on concrete implementations.

These principles help you build scalable, maintainable, and flexible systems. Understanding and applying SOLID principles will ensure that your codebase remains clean and adaptable to changes over time.
