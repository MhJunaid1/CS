What Are Features And Labels In ML? 
In machine learning (ML), **features** and **labels** are two fundamental concepts:

1. **Features**: These are the input variables or independent variables that the machine learning model uses to make predictions. Features are the characteristics or attributes of the data that are used to inform the model. In a dataset, features are often represented as columns. For example, in a dataset predicting house prices, features could include the size of the house, the number of bedrooms, the location, etc.

2. **Labels**: These are the output variables or dependent variables that the model is trying to predict. Labels are the known outcomes in supervised learning and are used to train the model. In the house price prediction example, the label would be the actual price of the house.

In summary:
- **Features** are the inputs to the model.
- **Labels** are the outputs the model aims to predict.
