What Are Features And Labels In ML? 
In machine learning (ML), **features** and **labels** are two fundamental concepts:

1. **Features**: These are the input variables or independent variables that the machine learning model uses to make predictions. Features are the characteristics or attributes of the data that are used to inform the model. In a dataset, features are often represented as columns. For example, in a dataset predicting house prices, features could include the size of the house, the number of bedrooms, the location, etc.

2. **Labels**: These are the output variables or dependent variables that the model is trying to predict. Labels are the known outcomes in supervised learning and are used to train the model. In the house price prediction example, the label would be the actual price of the house.

In summary:
- **Features** are the inputs to the model.
- **Labels** are the outputs the model aims to predict.

You can get data from:
- From your company
- From an investor willing to trust you on his data
- From online data scraping
- From UCI ML repository!
- From huggingface, kaggle etc

Supervised And Unsupervised Learning!

Supervised (Classification and Regression)
Classification (Classify which label a given set of features belong to!)
Regression (Find out the value of the label using previous data!)

Unsupervised (Clustering and Association)
Clustering (Discover the inherent groupings in the data, such as grouping customers by purchasing behavior)
Association (Association rule learning problem. Such as people that buy X also tend to buy Y)

Simple Linear Regression
Simple linear regression is a statistical method used to model the relationship between two variables by fitting a linear equation to observed data. It is called "simple" because it involves only one independent (predictor) variable and one dependent (response) variable.

### Components:
- **Independent Variable (X)**: This is the predictor or explanatory variable. It is the variable used to predict the value of the dependent variable.
- **Dependent Variable (Y)**: This is the outcome or response variable. It is the variable that you are trying to predict.


Simple linear regression is widely used in predictive modeling and is the foundation for more complex regression techniques.
