The key difference between AI (Artificial Intelligence) and Machine Learning (ML) lies in their scope and focus:

1. **Artificial Intelligence (AI)**: AI is a broad field that involves creating systems capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence. These tasks include reasoning, problem-solving, decision-making, language understanding, and even visual perception. AI encompasses various subfields such as machine learning, natural language processing, robotics, and expert systems.

2. **Machine Learning (ML)**: ML is a subset of AI that focuses on teaching machines to learn from data. Instead of explicitly programming the machine to perform a task, ML algorithms enable the machine to identify patterns in the data and make decisions or predictions based on that information. The more data the algorithm processes, the better it becomes at the task, without needing manual adjustments.

In summary, **AI is the broader concept** of machines mimicking human intelligence, while **machine learning is a specific approach** to achieving AI through data-driven learning.
