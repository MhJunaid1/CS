Git bash is used same as Linux/Unix terminal
commands like touch, mkdir, rm, rmdir, cat etc on Windows/MaxOS

When you initilize a empty git repository, it's branch is not allocated unless you made a first commit
default name of repo made by git init is master and branch name at github is main, so change 
local name to main from master

git config --global user.name "your_username"
git config --global user.email "your_email"
TO set username and password on git

git config --global --list
TO check if changed has been committed

git init 
To initialize a empty git repo

ls -lart
To show all the files from a git repo(creted by git init)

git status
To see status of files
git status -s
To see the short status






git add filename.extension
To start tracking untracked files modification

commit I(write commit description) -> esc -> :wq
git add -A: to add all untracked files to the staging area
git commit -m "message for commit"
if you have made changes to multiple files
and want to commit all the changes without
explicitly adding them to the staging area,
you can use the following command:
git commit -a -m "commit all the changes"
git checkout filename.extension: used to get the version of file of last commit
git checkout -f: used to checkout all the files of prev commit
git log: to view the all the commits made in the git repo
git log -p -(number of commits you want to see): press q to quit
git diff: to compare working tree with staging area
git diff --staged (compare staging area with last commit)
git rm --cached filename.extension: (to send file from committed area to untracked)
.gitignore filename: to be ignored present at any location of git local repo
.gitignore /filename: file would only ignored of present directory of gitignore dir
.gitignore *.extension: to ignore all files of that extension
.gitignore foldername/: to ignore a folder
git branch: to see all the branches in the repo
git branch branchName: to create a new branch
git branch -m (chaged name from current to new one) // can be -m or -M
git checkout (name of the branch you want to work):
git merge (name of the branch you want to merge to main)


To push code from local machine using git
we need to add ssh key in github account
To add an SSH key to your GitHub account, steps:

Generate an SSH key pair on your local machine 
using the following command in your terminal or Git Bash window:
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "l192250@lhr.nu.edu.pk"
Press enter on requiring to enter passphrase
Press enter and choose default location to save key
cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
TO locate the content of the public key
Now enter this public key in your github new ssh key field
and start pushing code on github

To add multiple ssh keys:
https://connkat.medium.com/setting-up-multiple-ssh-keys-on-one-computer-75f068d972d9
1->ssh-keygen -t rsa -C "youremail@mail.com"
2->It will prompt you for a file name, you should name it something like: id_rsa_personal
3->Create a config file
Still in the same terminal, try using ls to see if a file name config exists. If it does, use code config to open it up in your code editor. If it doesnâ€™t exist, you can create it by using touch config, then open it with code config. Copy and paste the following in your config:

# Work account
Host bitbucket.org
HostName bitbucket.org
IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa_work
User git
IdentitiesOnly yes
# Personal account
Host github.com
HostName github.com
IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa_personal
User git
IdentitiesOnly yes


4->Add keys to your accounts


Don't create .gitignore file as it don't allow the options(not 100% true)
just a observation
Prefer ssh over http for pushing code on github
git remote add origin git@github.com:jdKheppar/KaliGitHub.git

git push -u origin master/main
We use git push -u origin master command to push
the changes from the local repository's master branch
to the master branch of a remote repository named origin.

The -u flag is short for --set-upstream, which tells Git
to set the upstream branch to the remote repository's master branch.
This means that in the future, when you run git push without
specifying a branch, Git will know which branch to push to on the
remote repository.

Setting an upstream branch also allows you to use the git
pull command to fetch changes from the remote repository and
merge them into your local branch. For example, if
you have set the upstream branch for master to the remote
repository's master branch, you can run the following command
to fetch and merge changes:
git pull
git pull is used to get code from github.com , clone it to local repo

A fork on GitHub is a copy of a repository (i.e., a project's codebase, along with its associated files, documentation, and version history) that is created by another user, with the original repository remaining unchanged. Forks are a powerful feature of GitHub that allow users to contribute to open-source projects or create their own versions of existing projects.

When a user forks a repository, they create a separate copy of the original repository in their own GitHub account, which they can then modify, add to, and contribute to as they see fit. This allows developers to work on their own version of a project without disrupting the main codebase, and also allows users to make changes and improvements to open-source projects, which can then be reviewed and potentially merged back into the original repository.
