 CONCEPT
Insert an element from the unsorted array to its correct position in the
sorted array

 Complexity Analysis

 TIME COMPLEXITY
The time complexity of the Insertion Sort algorithm is O(n^2) in the average and worst cases, and O(n) in the best case.
it's important to note that while Insertion Sort has a quadratic time complexity, it can be efficient for small input sizes or PARTIALLY SORTED ARRAYS.
For larger input sizes or when sorting performance is critical, more efficient sorting algorithms like QuickSort or MergeSort are typically used.

 SPACE COMPLEXITY
The space complexity of the Insertion Sort algorithm is O(1) since it sorts the array in-place, without requiring
additional memory that grows with the input size. In other words, the algorithm uses a constant amount of extra memory,
