The `dotnet build` and `dotnet run` commands serve different purposes in the .NET ecosystem:

### 1. **dotnet build**
The `dotnet build` command compiles the source code of a .NET application into an executable or a library, but it **does not run the application**. It produces intermediate output (such as `.dll` or `.exe` files) that can be executed later.

#### Key Points:
- **Compiles the code**: It converts your source code into Intermediate Language (IL) that can run on the .NET runtime.
- **Outputs files**: It generates output files, such as `.dll` (for libraries) or `.exe` (for console apps), in the `bin` directory.
- **Checks for errors**: It performs syntax checking and ensures there are no errors in the code.
- **No execution**: It does not actually execute the compiled code; it just prepares the application to be executed.

#### Example:
```bash
dotnet build
```

- This command will create a compiled output of your project but will not run it.

### 2. **dotnet run**
The `dotnet run` command compiles the code (if necessary) and **executes the application** in one step. It is often used during development for quickly testing changes without having to manually build the project and then execute it.

#### Key Points:
- **Combines build and run**: If the application is not already built or the code has changed, it will first build the application and then run it.
- **Runs the application**: After building, it executes the application, making it useful for development testing.
- **No intermediate files**: While it performs a build, `dotnet run` does not always leave the intermediate `.dll` or `.exe` files behind (like `dotnet build` does).
- **Convenient for quick tests**: Itâ€™s particularly helpful for fast development iteration.

#### Example:
```bash
dotnet run
```

- This command will compile and run your application in a single step.

### Key Differences:
| **Aspect**              | **dotnet build**                          | **dotnet run**                                      |
|-------------------------|--------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| **Primary Function**     | Compiles the code into binary outputs      | Compiles (if necessary) and then runs the application|
| **Produces Output**      | Yes, produces `.dll` or `.exe` files       | Not always (temporary build, no persistent files)    |
| **Executes Application** | No                                         | Yes, after compiling                                |
| **Use Case**             | Building production-ready binaries         | Quickly testing or running during development       |

In summary, `dotnet build` is for compiling the code into binary files, while `dotnet run` is for quickly compiling (if needed) and running the application during development.
