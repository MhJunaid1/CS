The `obj` folder in each .NET project serves as a temporary workspace where the .NET build system stores intermediate files and information during the build process. Here are some key purposes and files within the `obj` folder:

1. **Intermediate Compilation Files**: It stores intermediate files generated during compilation, like `.obj` files and generated source files. These files help the compiler efficiently create the final assembly without needing to recompile unchanged code.

2. **Generated Code**: When using tools that generate additional code during build time (like Razor files in ASP.NET Core or resources in WPF), these generated files are stored in the `obj` folder. This is especially useful for partial classes or other generated content that supplements the main code.

3. **MSBuild Files**: It contains project-related `.g.csproj` files, where MSBuild-specific data, references, and other build information are stored. These files instruct MSBuild on the order and dependencies during compilation.

4. **Assembly Info**: In .NET Core, `AssemblyInfo.cs` files are auto-generated in `obj`, containing metadata (like versioning information) for the final assembly.

5. **NuGet Cache**: When building, NuGet uses the `obj` folder to manage information about package dependencies and project assets. This includes project dependency files like `project.assets.json` which details resolved dependencies and their versions.

The `obj` folder is automatically cleaned and recreated as needed during builds, so it's usually safe to delete if you're troubleshooting issues, although deleting it will force a full rebuild.
