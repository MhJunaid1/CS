# üîÑ Delegates in .NET C#: The Complete Guide

In C#, **delegates** are a foundational feature that allow methods to be treated as **first-class citizens**‚Äîjust like variables. They're incredibly useful for designing **flexible**, **extensible**, and **decoupled** systems.

Whether you‚Äôre working with **events**, **LINQ**, or **custom callbacks**, understanding delegates is key to writing clean and maintainable .NET code.

---

## üß† What Is a Delegate?

A **delegate** is a **type-safe object** that can **reference a method** with a specific signature. You can pass this reference around, store it, and call it dynamically‚Äîlike a method pointer in C or a function variable in JavaScript or Python.

### üî§ Syntax Example

```csharp
public delegate void Notify();  // Declaring a delegate

public class Process
{
    public void StartProcess(Notify notify)
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Process Started...");
        notify();  // Call the delegate
    }
}
```

```csharp
class Program
{
    static void SendEmail()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Email Sent!");
    }

    static void Main()
    {
        var process = new Process();
        Notify notifyDelegate = SendEmail;
        process.StartProcess(notifyDelegate);
    }
}
```

## üí° Why Use Delegates?

| Benefit                        | Description                                                                 |
|-------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Loose Coupling**            | Code that calls a delegate doesn't care what method gets executed.         |
| **Flexibility**               | Behavior can be passed as parameters.                                       |
| **Extensibility**             | You can plug in new behavior without changing core logic.                  |
| **Multicast Support**         | Delegates can call **multiple methods** in order.                          |
| **Foundation for Events**     | Delegates are the basis of the **event** model in .NET.                    |

## üõ† Types of Delegates

### ‚úÖ 1. **Single-Cast Delegates**

These point to **a single method**:

```csharp
public delegate void PrintMessage(string message);

PrintMessage printer = Console.WriteLine;
printer("Hello, World!");
```

---

### üîó 2. **Multicast Delegates**

These can point to **multiple methods**, and they execute **in order**:

```csharp
PrintMessage printer = MethodA;
printer += MethodB;
printer("Hi!");

// Both MethodA and MethodB are called.
```

*Note: Return values of previous methods are ignored unless you use `Func<T>` and invoke the delegate manually.*

---

### ‚öôÔ∏è 3. **Built-In Delegates**

.NET offers generic delegate types that remove the need for custom delegate declarations.

| Built-in Delegate | Signature                                  | Usage                     |
|-------------------|--------------------------------------------|---------------------------|
| `Action<T>`       | Takes parameters, returns `void`           | `Action<string>`          |
| `Func<T, TResult>`| Takes parameters, returns a value          | `Func<int, int, string>`  |
| `Predicate<T>`    | Takes one parameter, returns `bool`        | Used for filtering logic  |

Example:

```csharp
Action<string> printer = Console.WriteLine;
Func<int, int, int> add = (x, y) => x + y;
Predicate<int> isEven = num => num % 2 == 0;
```

## üì£ Delegates vs Interfaces vs Events

| Feature           | Delegate                        | Interface                    | Event                           |
|------------------|----------------------------------|-------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| Use For           | Callbacks, plugins, event hooks | Behavior contracts            | Broadcasting one-to-many calls  |
| Flexibility       | High                            | Medium                        | High (based on delegate usage)  |
| Can have multiple methods? | Yes (multicast)           | No                            | Yes                              |
| Runtime Plug-in? | Yes                              | Less common                   | Yes                              |

## üîå Real-World Use Cases

- **LINQ and functional programming**  
  ```csharp
  var evens = numbers.Where(n => n % 2 == 0);
  ```
- **Asynchronous programming**  
  ```csharp
  Task.Run(() => DoWork());
  ```
- **Custom event handling**  
  ```csharp
  button.Click += OnClick;
  ```
- **Plugin architectures**  
  Pass behavior at runtime via delegates.

---

## üß™ Example: Delegate in Action

```csharp
public class PhotoProcessor
{
    public delegate void PhotoFilterHandler(Photo photo);

    public void Process(string path, PhotoFilterHandler handler)
    {
        var photo = Photo.Load(path);
        handler(photo);  // Dynamically apply filters
        photo.Save();
    }
}
```

Usage:

```csharp
var processor = new PhotoProcessor();
PhotoProcessor.PhotoFilterHandler filters = ApplyBrightness;
filters += ApplyContrast;

processor.Process("image.jpg", filters);
```

## üßµ Final Words

**Delegates** are one of C#'s most powerful features. They allow you to:

- Treat methods as data
- Compose behaviors at runtime
- Enable extensible and maintainable architectures

If you understand delegates well, you're on your way to mastering **LINQ**, **events**, **asynchronous programming**, and **dependency injection**‚Äîall key parts of modern .NET development.
