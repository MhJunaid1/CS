Running the command

```bash
dotnet ef database update --verbose --project Bulky.DataAccess --startup-project BulkyWeb
```

does the following:

- **`dotnet ef database update`**: Updates your database to the latest migration. This applies any pending migrations to the database, creating or updating tables and schemas as defined in the migration files.

- **`--verbose`**: Provides detailed output in the console. This is useful for debugging, as it gives more insight into what Entity Framework Core is doing behind the scenes, such as SQL commands being executed.

- **`--project Bulky.DataAccess`**: Specifies the project that contains your Entity Framework Core `DbContext` and migrations. Here, `Bulky.DataAccess` is where the migration files and context (e.g., `ApplicationDbContext`) are stored.

- **`--startup-project BulkyWeb`**: Specifies the project that starts the application. This is useful when your `DbContext` is in a library or a separate project. `BulkyWeb` likely contains the `Program.cs` and configuration files needed to initialize the application.

This command tells Entity Framework Core to look for migrations and the `DbContext` in `Bulky.DataAccess` but to use the configurations (like connection strings) from `BulkyWeb`. This setup is common in multi-project solutions where the data access layer is separate from the main application.
