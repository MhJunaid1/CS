### 🔷 **IIS (Internet Information Services)**

#### 🧠 What is it?
**IIS** is a **web server** developed by Microsoft. It’s used to **host and serve websites, web applications, and services** on **Windows**.

Think of it as the **middleman between your app and the internet**.

It can:
- Handle **HTTP/HTTPS** requests
- Host **ASP.NET**, **PHP**, **static HTML**, **APIs**
- Manage **SSL certificates**
- Control **authentication**, **logging**, and **app pools**

---

### 🏢 Real-World Analogy:
Imagine you're running a restaurant:
- **IIS** is the **waiter** taking orders from customers (browsers) and delivering food (web pages) from the kitchen (your app).
- It handles **requests**, manages who gets what, and ensures the kitchen doesn’t burn out.

### 🖥️ What Can You Host with IIS?
- Company websites: `www.company.com`
- Internal portals: `intranet.company.com`
- Web APIs: `api.company.com`
- Web dashboards, forms, and services

---

### 🔧 Key Features of IIS:
- **Application Pools** (run apps in isolation)
- **SSL/HTTPS support**
- **Logging and diagnostics**
- **Authentication/Authorization**
- **Request filtering**
- **Static and dynamic content handling**

---

### 💡 Example:
You build a .NET Core web app. You want your team to access it internally:
- You host it on a Windows Server using **IIS**
- You assign it to an **App Pool**
- Now it’s accessible at `http://yourserver/myapp`
