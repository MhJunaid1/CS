If you want to **expose your local website to the internet**, there are a few ways to do it depending on your needs.

---

### 🛠️ ✅ 1. **Use a Tool Like `ngrok` (Easiest & Popular)**
This is the quickest and safest way to expose your localhost temporarily.

#### 🔧 Steps:
1. Download and install **ngrok**: https://ngrok.com
2. Run your local site (e.g., at `http://localhost:5187`)
3. Open terminal and run:
   ```
   ngrok http 5187
   ```
4. Ngrok will generate a public URL like:
   ```
   https://12c4-45-31-204-20.ngrok.io
   ```
5. You can share that URL, and it will tunnel to your local server.

#### ✅ Pros:
- Super easy
- Free tier available
- Great for demos, testing APIs, mobile testing, etc.

### 🌐 ✅ 2. **Port Forwarding via Your Router** (More permanent)

#### 🔧 Steps:
1. Run your site on a fixed local port (e.g., `5187`)
2. Login to your **router** and configure **port forwarding**
   - Forward external port (e.g., `80`) to your PC's local IP on port `5187`
3. Make sure **firewall** allows traffic on that port
4. Get your **public IP** from https://whatismyipaddress.com
5. Access your site at:
   ```
   http://<your-public-ip>:80
   ```

#### ⚠️ Cons:
- Less secure
- Needs static IP or dynamic DNS
- Not recommended unless you know what you’re doing

### ☁️ ✅ 3. **Deploy to a Free Cloud Platform**
If you want to **host it properly**, deploy your app to:
- **Azure App Service** (great for .NET apps)
- **Render.com** (free tier)
- **Vercel** / **Netlify** (good for frontend)
- **Heroku** (basic apps)
