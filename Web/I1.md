Let’s go through each question with possible answers that align with a junior software engineer's experience and knowledge:

### 1. **C# and .NET Core**
   - **What are the key differences between .NET Framework and .NET Core?**
     - .NET Framework is designed primarily for Windows applications, whereas .NET Core is cross-platform and can run on Windows, macOS, and Linux. .NET Core also provides better performance and can be used to develop modern, cloud-based, and IoT applications. 

   - **Explain how garbage collection works in C#.**
     - Garbage collection in C# is an automatic memory management system that cleans up unused objects to free memory. It operates in generations (0, 1, and 2), where objects that survive garbage collections move to a higher generation. The collector triggers based on memory allocation and attempts to reclaim memory that is no longer referenced.

   - **What is the difference between `async` and `await` in C#?**
     - `async` marks a method as asynchronous, meaning it can run operations that don't block the main thread. `await` is used to pause the execution of an async method until the awaited task is complete, without blocking the thread.

   - **How do you handle exceptions in C#? Can you explain different exception types?**
     - In C#, exceptions are handled using `try-catch-finally` blocks. `try` contains the code that might throw exceptions, `catch` handles specific exceptions, and `finally` is executed regardless of whether an exception occurred. Common exception types include `NullReferenceException`, `ArgumentException`, `IndexOutOfRangeException`, and `InvalidOperationException`.

   - **What is the role of Dependency Injection in .NET Core?**
     - Dependency Injection (DI) is a design pattern used to achieve Inversion of Control (IoC) in .NET Core. It helps decouple objects and their dependencies, making applications more modular and testable. In .NET Core, DI is built-in and allows you to inject services, such as logging or database access, into your classes.

### 2. **ASP.NET and MVC Framework**
   - **Can you explain the MVC pattern and its components (Model, View, Controller)?**
     - MVC stands for Model-View-Controller. The Model represents the application data and logic, the View displays the data (UI), and the Controller handles user input and interacts with the Model to update the View. This separation of concerns makes the application easier to manage and test.

   - **How do you handle state management in ASP.NET?**
     - In ASP.NET, state management can be handled using client-side options like cookies, query strings, and hidden fields or server-side options like sessions, application state, and ViewState. These techniques help maintain data across requests in a stateless HTTP protocol.

   - **What is routing in ASP.NET MVC? How does it work?**
     - Routing in ASP.NET MVC is used to map incoming requests to the appropriate controller and action method. It uses a URL pattern to define routes, and the routing engine parses the URL and invokes the matching controller. For example, a route template might look like `{controller}/{action}/{id}`.

   - **Can you explain filters in MVC and their types (Authorization, Action, Exception)?**
     - Filters in MVC are used to execute code before or after certain stages of the request processing pipeline. Authorization filters handle authentication and authorization, Action filters run before or after an action is executed, and Exception filters handle errors thrown during controller actions.

   - **How would you secure an ASP.NET MVC application?**
     - To secure an ASP.NET MVC application, use HTTPS to encrypt communication, implement authentication and authorization, use anti-forgery tokens for forms (to prevent CSRF attacks), sanitize inputs to avoid SQL injection, and enable data validation to ensure the integrity of user input.

### 3. **Design and Development**
   - **How would you approach designing an application from scratch?**
     - I would start by gathering and analyzing requirements, followed by defining the application architecture and data models. I’d then choose the appropriate technologies and frameworks, design the UI/UX, and plan the project structure. I would also ensure proper testing and deployment strategies are in place.

   - **Can you explain SOLID principles and why they are important in object-oriented design?**
     - SOLID is a set of five principles that make software designs more understandable, flexible, and maintainable:
     1. **S**ingle Responsibility Principle: A class should have only one reason to change.
     2. **O**pen/Closed Principle: Classes should be open for extension but closed for modification.
     3. **L**iskov Substitution Principle: Subtypes should be replaceable by their base types.
     4. **I**nterface Segregation Principle: No client should be forced to depend on methods it doesn’t use.
     5. **D**ependency Inversion Principle: Depend on abstractions, not on concretions.

   - **What is the purpose of unit testing, and how do you write unit tests in C#?**
     - Unit testing ensures that individual components of your application work as expected. In C#, unit tests are written using testing frameworks like MSTest, NUnit, or xUnit. A unit test typically involves setting up the environment, invoking methods, and asserting that the expected and actual outcomes match.

   - **How do you handle version control, and what tools have you used (e.g., Git)?**
     - I use Git for version control. It allows me to track changes, collaborate with other developers, and manage different versions of the codebase through branches. I’ve used Git with platforms like GitHub and GitLab to push, pull, and merge code, as well as handle conflicts.

   - **Describe a situation where you optimized the performance of an application.**
     - In one project, I optimized database query performance by adding indexes to frequently queried columns, reducing the query time from several seconds to milliseconds. I also optimized application logic by caching frequently used data, which improved response times.

### 4. **SQL Server**
   - **What are the differences between `INNER JOIN`, `LEFT JOIN`, and `RIGHT JOIN`?**
     - `INNER JOIN` returns only the records that have matching values in both tables. `LEFT JOIN` returns all records from the left table and matching records from the right table, with NULL for non-matching rows. `RIGHT JOIN` does the opposite, returning all records from the right table and matching rows from the left.

   - **How would you optimize a slow query in SQL Server?**
     - To optimize a slow query, I would first examine the query plan to identify bottlenecks. I might add indexes to columns used in joins or WHERE clauses, avoid using SELECT *, rewrite subqueries, or split large queries into smaller, more manageable parts.

   - **Explain how you would handle transactions in SQL.**
     - Transactions in SQL ensure that a series of operations are executed as a single unit of work. I would use `BEGIN TRANSACTION`, followed by SQL statements, and use `COMMIT` to save the changes if all operations succeed or `ROLLBACK` to undo changes if any part fails.

   - **What are stored procedures and when should you use them?**
     - Stored procedures are precompiled SQL code that can be executed repeatedly. They are used to encapsulate logic, improve performance, and reduce redundancy by reusing the same code. They also help enhance security by controlling data access.

   - **Can you explain normalization and denormalization?**
     - Normalization is the process of organizing a database to reduce redundancy and improve data integrity by dividing large tables into smaller, related ones. Denormalization, on the other hand, is the process of combining tables to reduce the number of joins needed for queries, sometimes at the expense of redundancy.

### 5. **Angular & Frontend Development**
   - **What is two-way data binding in Angular?**
     - Two-way data binding in Angular allows synchronization between the model and the view. When the user updates the view (like in an input field), the model is automatically updated, and vice versa. This is done using the `ngModel` directive in Angular.

   - **How would you manage state in an Angular application?**
     - In Angular, state management can be handled using services or libraries like NgRx or BehaviorSubject. Services provide a central place to store state, while libraries like NgRx manage state in a Redux-like pattern, offering better control over application state.

   - **Can you explain how components work in Angular?**
     - Components in Angular are the building blocks of the application’s UI. Each component has a TypeScript class, an HTML template, and optional CSS styles. Components communicate with each other through inputs and outputs, and the root component (app component) serves as the entry point of the application.

   - **How do you handle HTTP requests in Angular?**
     - HTTP requests in Angular are handled using the `HttpClient` service. You can use `HttpClient` to perform GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, and other HTTP operations. It supports observables, making it easy to handle asynchronous data streams.

### 6. **WPF**
   - **What is MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) in WPF, and how is it different from MVC?**
     - MVVM is a design pattern commonly used in WPF applications. The Model represents the data, the View is the user interface, and the ViewModel acts as a bridge that handles logic and connects the Model to the View. Unlike MVC, MVVM separates the UI logic into the ViewModel, which makes WPF applications easier to test.

   - **How do you bind data in WPF, and what types of

 data binding are available?**
     - In WPF, data binding is used to connect UI elements to data sources like objects or databases. The types of data binding include One-Way, Two-Way, One-Way to Source, and One-Time. Two-way binding is commonly used for editable forms where UI changes should update the underlying data model.

   - **What are dependency properties, and why are they used in WPF?**
     - Dependency properties in WPF are a special type of property that allows for property value inheritance, data binding, and change notifications. They are used to reduce memory consumption and improve the flexibility of WPF controls by allowing values to be set via styles, animations, and data binding.

### 7. **Behavioral Questions**
   - **Describe a challenging project you worked on and how you overcame the difficulties.**
     - I worked on a project where we faced performance issues due to inefficient database queries. I collaborated with the team to analyze the queries, optimized them by adding indexes, and refactored parts of the code. This reduced the load time significantly and improved user experience.

   - **How do you approach learning new tools or technologies?**
     - I start by reading the official documentation and tutorials. Then, I try building small projects or prototypes to apply what I’ve learned. If I face challenges, I use online resources like StackOverflow or community forums to find solutions.

   - **How do you handle tight deadlines and conflicting priorities?**
     - I prioritize tasks by assessing their urgency and importance, then communicate clearly with the team to ensure expectations are aligned. I break down tasks into manageable parts and maintain a clear schedule to stay on track, adjusting when necessary.

   - **Can you give an example of when you worked in a team and your role within it?**
     - In a recent project, I worked as part of a small team responsible for building a web application. I handled the backend development using ASP.NET Core, collaborated closely with the frontend team, and participated in daily stand-ups to track progress and resolve blockers.
