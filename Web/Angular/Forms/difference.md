You’re absolutely right in observing that **Reactive Forms** do support a form of data synchronization between the component and the view, which can resemble two-way data binding. However, there’s a subtle difference in how it works compared to traditional two-way data binding with `[(ngModel)]` in Angular.

### Key Differences

1. **Two-Way Data Binding with `[(ngModel)]`** (Template-Driven):
   - In template-driven forms, Angular’s `[(ngModel)]` provides **automatic two-way binding**, where changes in the input field are directly and automatically reflected in the component model, and vice versa, with minimal code.
   - The `[(ngModel)]` directive automatically manages this binding.

2. **Explicit Data Flow in Reactive Forms**:
   - In reactive forms, **data synchronization is not automatic** in the same way. Instead:
     - **Component to View**: You programmatically define the form model in the component and bind it to the template using `[formGroup]` and `formControlName`.
     - **View to Component**: To observe changes from the form controls (view) and use them in the component, you typically subscribe to `.valueChanges` on the controls. This makes updates **explicit**, meaning Angular does not inherently manage it for you in the same way as `[(ngModel)]`.
   - Additionally, if you want to update the form model from the component side, you have to call methods like `setValue()` or `patchValue()` explicitly. 

### Why Reactive Forms Aren't Considered "Two-Way Bound" in the Same Sense

- **Control**: With reactive forms, data binding is **more controlled** and explicit rather than automatic. It allows for unidirectional data flow from the component to the view and allows you to capture user input in a more managed way.
- **Observation vs. Binding**: `.valueChanges` provides an observable to "listen" to changes rather than binding the value automatically. In reactive forms, you explicitly decide what to do with the new values by subscribing to this observable, whereas in two-way data binding, Angular would automatically apply these changes to the component.

### Summary

While **Reactive Forms** do enable a form of synchronization between the form model and the view, it requires explicit programming, whereas traditional two-way data binding (`[(ngModel)]`) in template-driven forms is automatic. Reactive forms offer greater control but do not rely on Angular’s two-way binding syntax (`[(ngModel)]`) or its internal change detection for form data updates.
