Let me clarify the snippet for you:

```typescript
@Component({
  selector: 'app-child',
  providers: [MyService] // Service is registered here
})
export class ChildComponent {
  constructor(private myService: MyService) {} // Service is used here
}
```

### **What's happening here?**

1. **`providers` in `@Component`**
   - The `providers: [MyService]` line registers the `MyService` **specifically for this component and its children** in the dependency injection hierarchy.
   - This means a **new, separate instance** of `MyService` will be created **exclusively for this component** (`ChildComponent`) and its children in the component tree.

2. **Dependency Injection in the Constructor**
   - The `constructor(private myService: MyService)` requests an instance of `MyService`.
   - Angular's **injector** checks where `MyService` is provided:
     - Since the `providers` array in this component explicitly provides `MyService`, **a new instance is injected** into this component.

---

### **Why register `MyService` in the `providers` of `@Component`?**

This approach **scopes the service** to the component and its children. It ensures that:
1. **Isolation:**  
   Other components outside `ChildComponent` won’t have access to the same instance of `MyService`.
2. **Encapsulation:**  
   If `ChildComponent` (or its descendants) modifies the state of the service, these changes won’t affect other components that use `MyService` globally or elsewhere.
3. **Control Over Instances:**  
   A new instance is created for this component, so it doesn’t share state with the globally provided instance.

---

### **What does it mean if it's "only consuming the service"?**
Even though `ChildComponent` is consuming `MyService` (via the constructor), the snippet scopes the service's **lifecycle** and **state** specifically to this component. Without the `providers` declaration, the service would be resolved from a higher injector (like the root injector), sharing the same instance across multiple components.

---

### **Example Use Case**
Imagine you want a `CounterService` to track a counter separately in each `ChildComponent`. By declaring it in `providers`, each component gets its own counter instance:

```typescript
@Component({
  selector: 'app-child',
  providers: [CounterService]
})
export class ChildComponent {
  counter = 0;

  constructor(private counterService: CounterService) {}

  increment() {
    this.counter = this.counterService.increment(); // Local counter instance
  }
}
```

If the service were globally provided, the same counter would be shared across all components using `CounterService`. By scoping it locally, each `ChildComponent` gets its own independent counter.
