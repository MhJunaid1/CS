Strongly typed languages require variables to be declared with a specific data type and strictly enforce that type throughout the program. This means that a variable declared as an integer cannot be assigned a string value later on, and vice versa. Examples of strongly typed languages include Java, C++, and Rust.

On the other hand, weakly typed (or loosely typed) languages do not require variables to be declared with a specific data type, and allow for implicit type coercion. This means that a variable can be assigned a value of any data type, and the language will automatically convert the value to the appropriate type when necessary. Examples of weakly typed languages include PHP, Perl, and JavaScript.

It's worth noting that the terms "strong" and "weak" are not universally agreed upon and can have different meanings depending on the context. Some people use "strong" to refer to languages with a high degree of type safety, while others use it to refer to languages with strict type checking. Similarly, some people use "weak" to refer to languages with dynamic typing, while others use it to refer to languages with weak type checking.

As for Python, it is generally considered to be a strongly typed language. Although Python is dynamically typed (meaning that data types are determined at runtime), it enforces strict type checking and does not allow for implicit type coercion. However, Python's type system does have some flexibility - for example, a variable can be assigned a value of any type, and it can also be reassigned to a different type later on in the program.
