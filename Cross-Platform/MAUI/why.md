We use **cross-platform app development technologies** like **Xamarin, .NET MAUI, Flutter, and React Native** because they allow developers to **write code once and run it on multiple platforms** (iOS, Android, Windows, macOS, etc.). Hereâ€™s why they are popular:  

### **1. Code Reusability**  
- A significant portion of the code (sometimes up to **90%**) can be shared across platforms, reducing development time.  

### **2. Faster Development & Reduced Costs**  
- Instead of maintaining **separate codebases** for Android and iOS, one team can build and maintain a **single codebase**, lowering development and maintenance costs.  

### **3. Easier Maintenance & Updates**  
- Fixing bugs and pushing updates is easier because changes need to be made **only once** rather than separately for each platform.  

### **4. Consistency Across Platforms**  
- Cross-platform frameworks ensure that the app provides a **consistent user experience** on different operating systems.  

### **5. Wider Audience Reach**  
- A single app can run on **both Android and iOS**, helping businesses reach more users **without extra effort**.  

### **6. Access to Native Features**  
- Modern cross-platform frameworks allow access to **device-specific features** (camera, GPS, Bluetooth, etc.) through **native bindings or plugins**.  

### **7. Community & Ecosystem Growth**  
- Cross-platform tools like **Flutter, React Native, and .NET MAUI** have large communities and strong support from companies like Google, Meta, and Microsoft.  

### **When NOT to Use Cross-Platform Tech?**  
- If the app requires **high-performance gaming**, **AR/VR**, or **complex native interactions**, a native app (Swift for iOS, Kotlin for Android) might be a better choice.
