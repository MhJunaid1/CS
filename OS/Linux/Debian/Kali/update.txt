When should you update Kali?

If you have a default installation of Kali, you should be checking for updates every few weeks. If you need a new version of a tool, or hear about a security update,
that may speed up the timetable. However, a good practice is that you ensure all tools work before an engagement and during that engagement you should not update.
As Kali is a rolling release, once in a while issues will sneak into rolling and may break a tool that is needed.

1-> sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade
also in a single line you can write sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade

2-> sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade
to update and upgrade together
