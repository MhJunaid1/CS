Explanation:

The first line (#!/bin/bash) is the shebang line, which specifies that the script should be interpreted by the Bash shell.
The script starts by printing the prompt message, "What is your name?", using the echo command.
The read command is used to read the user's input and store it in the name variable.
Next, the script uses the echo command again to greet the user by concatenating the value of the name variable with the string "Hello, ".
The script then uses the date command with the +%Y-%m-%d format to obtain the current date and assigns it to the current_date variable.
Finally, the script displays the current date by printing the value of the current_date variable.
To run the script, save it with a .sh file extension (e.g., greeting_script.sh), set execute permissions (chmod +x greeting_script.sh),
and execute it by running ./greeting_script.sh in the terminal. Use sudo chmod +x greetings_script.sh if does not work without sudo

When the script runs, it will prompt you to enter your name. After entering your name, it will greet you and display the current date.
