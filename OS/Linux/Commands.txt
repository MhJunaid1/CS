5->For an empty folder, you can still provide the -r flag, but the dedicated -d flag applies to this case. Without this flag,
you will get the same error rm: [folder]: is a directory.
To delete an empty directory, you can use this command:
rm -d test
It is recommended to use the -d flag for empty directory cases instead of the -r flag because the -d flag ensures that a directory is empty.
If it is not empty, you will get the error rm: test: Directory not empty. So, to be sure you are performing the proper empty directory operation, use the -d flag. 

6->The rmdir command is specifically used to delete empty directories. The syntax is:
rmdir [folders]
It is the equivalent of the rm command with the -d flag: rm -d.

Concatenate, or cat, is one of the most frequently used Linux commands. It lists, combines, and writes file content to the standard output. To run the cat command, type cat followed by the file name and its extension. For instance:

cat filename.txt.

Here are other ways to use the cat command:

cat > filename.txt creates a new file.
cat filename1.txt filename2.txt > filename3.txt merges filename1.txt and filename2.txt and stores the output in filename3.txt.
tac filename.txt displays content in reverse order.
